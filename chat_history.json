You want to create a React Native app using Expo for hip-hop beatmakers to search for music samples, preview them from YouTube, and get copy links. The app should allow filtering by year/era and genre. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Sample Search & Preview:** A central screen where users can search for samples using keywords. Display YouTube previews of the samples directly within the app.\n-   **Filtering:** Implement filtering options by year/era (e.g., 1970s, 1980s, 1990s) and genre (e.g., Soul, Funk, Jazz, Blues).\n-   **Copy Link:** Provide a button or icon to easily copy the YouTube link of the selected sample.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#121212` (Dark gray, almost black - modern and sleek)\n    *   Text: `#FFFFFF` (Pure white for high contrast)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#A0A0A0` (Light gray for less important information)\n    *   Primary: `#FF4081` (A vibrant pink/magenta for primary actions and highlights)\n    *   Secondary: `#64B5F6` (A calming blue for secondary actions)\n    *   Accent: `#FFD740` (A golden yellow for subtle accents and highlights)\n    *   Card: `#1E1E1E` (A slightly lighter dark gray for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#B3E5FC` (A very light blue for selection highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use \"System\" font for a modern, clean look that adapts well to different platforms.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Implement the search bar at the top of the screen.\n    *   Create a component to display sample results (YouTube previews, title, and \"Copy Link\" button).\n    *   Add filtering UI elements (dropdowns or buttons) for year/era and genre.\n    *   Connect the search bar and filters to the sample display component to dynamically update results.\n2.  **Create a new component for displaying YouTube previews:**\n    *   This component will take a YouTube video ID as input and render a preview using a library like `react-native-youtube-iframe`.\n    *   Include a \"Copy Link\" button that copies the YouTube URL to the clipboard.\n3.  **Implement filtering logic:**\n    *   Create functions to filter the sample data based on the selected year/era and genre.\n    *   Update the sample display component to use the filtered data.\n4.  **Remove modal demos:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-24T23:48:27.583998"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a music sample search app for hip-hop beatmakers with YouTube integration.
